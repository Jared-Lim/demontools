Third, if you want contribute to any part of the tool (please do - it can only make it better), look at the bottom of the page.</p>" +
"<h2>Death and Charon</h2><p>You die when the entire party dies; however, you won't necessarily get a game over. You will arrive at the river Styx where the ferryman, Charon, will inform you that he can be bribed. If you pay Charon macca, he will revive you in the same state just prior to your last battle. If you don't have the macca to be revived he will put it on a tab. Once you have the macca he will immediately mug you, ruining your day. If you die a second time, you get a free pass and casual mode will be unlocked. After this, if you die and still owe Charon money, you will get a real game over screen. Charon isn't a feature, he is a punishment for not saving. Macca is not abundant in this game and should be spent on essential healing items, gear, and pulling demons from the book (in that order, if you even need additional items). If you find yourself spending your macca on Charon, you may find you have less money to stay alive and enjoy an endless cycle of having squat. The key here is to <b>save often</b> and use Charon as a last resort if you forgot to save for a very long time. If you have saved recently, screw Charon, reload from your save.</p>" +
"<h2>Saving</h2><p>In this game you can now save anywhere. <b>Abuse this feature.</b> There are two save slots (come on really Atlus?). I suggest using the top slot for your OCD saving habit (don't have one? it's never too late to start). Use the second slot right before or right after you complete a dungeon and are safe inside a town. This way, if you screw yourself into a corner you can't get out of, you have a fallback save where you can prepare better and try again. I can not stress this enough: <b>save</b>. Once you are done with that, <b>save</b>. The game is very unforgiving for those who don't save. Any battle can <i>easily</i> turn south and having you bending over for Charon or sailing across the river Styx. If you value your sanity, <b>save</b> as often as you can.</p>"
